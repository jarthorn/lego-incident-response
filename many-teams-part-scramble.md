This is a simple exercise for a large group. You will end up with groups of about 8 people per group. Membership will be scrambled which helps participant get to know more team members they don't usually work with.

Steps:

- Buy or obtain one lego set per group. 
- Divide each lego set into 8 bags (either original part bags, or large zip-lock bags).
- Scramble all the part bags together, and leave them in a big pile.
- Stack the lego manuals somewhere clearly visible in the room.
- Bring participants into the room.
- Tell each participant to take one bag. Their goal is to build the set that those parts belong to. They need to find the people in the room building the same set, then get together and build it.
- If they don't notice the manuals, after a few minutes of chaos you can point them out.
