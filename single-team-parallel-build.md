This is a simple exercise for a single team. You can adapt the set used based on the size of team. Budget roughly 100 parts per person per hour. For example, a 3000 piece set with 10 people could take roughly three hours. A maximum of 8-10 people were team is recommended. If you have more people, get more lego sets and run them in parallel. A larger set will make the challenge more interesting and memorable!

Setup: Team is given a boxed, disassembled lego set, with instructions. The goal is simply to build the set as fast as possible.

Lego instructions are highly sequential. How do you break down a sequential task and complete it as fast as possible with a large group of people? There are no other rules imposed. Team members can use computers, lookup information online, etc.

As with a real computer incident, everyone instinctively knows what the end result looks like, the challenge is how to get there as fast as possible. Also like a real incident, there are no other rules defined. Do what it takes to restore service to the lego structure as fast as possible.
